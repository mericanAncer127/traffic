PRO
======

  - Manage your Jekyll site from your web-browser using a proper editor


CONTRA
======

  - Programmer-centric
  - The problem with guessing with repositories is actually quite costly.
  - Dilemma with arbitrary branches?


POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS
======

  - Create an application specific API
  - Use a small server, that exposes a better API for doing things
  - Use facets instead of folders
  - Use our own document representation (flexible: can be used for blog posts or microsite specifications)
  - Publishing options
     - We can still use Jekyll as an output format and write it using a github adapter
     - Or we just generate a static HTML page and push it to a gh-pages branch.
