# Prose

[Prose](http://prose.io) is a web-based interface for managing text-based
content in your GitHub repositories. Use it to create, edit, and delete files,
 and save your changes directly to GitHub.

Prose makes quick updates to code or managing a blog. Prose pays special
attention to [Jekyll sites](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
[hosted on GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) with Markdown text preview
and syntax reference. It's [configurable](http://prose.io/help/handbook.html)
to restrict users to files that live within the `_posts` directory so you can
use it to manage the content on your blog.
