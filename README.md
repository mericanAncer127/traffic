Columnist
============

Columnist is a Visual Editor that helps you manage your Jekyll-based website. It should work with any Jekyll-based website out the box. However, it makes a few assumptions about the file layout you have:

- Assumes posts live within `_posts` or a subdirectory
- Only Markdown posts are supported yet, so Columnist only looks for the .md file extension


Quickstart
============

1. Open http://columnist.devseed.com in your browser.

2. Login with your Github username + password.

3. Select a repository containing a Jekyll-website.

4. Switch between Categories (= subdirectories that live within _posts).

5. Open a file.

6. Make some changes.

7. Save it.
