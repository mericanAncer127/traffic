Columnist is a web-based interface for managing Jekyll-based websites.

Synopsis
========

Columnist is a web-interface dedicated for managing dynamic content of
Jekyll-based websites. Users of Columnist can create and edit files that
live within the `_posts` directory. Columnist is just a static webpage,
without requiring any server-side bits. Instead it interacts directly
with the Github API for managing your repo's contents.

How does it work?
=================

Open [http://columnist.devseed.com](http://columnist.devseed.com) in
your browser and login with your Github username and password.

Once you've managed that you are asked to select a repository containing
a Jekyll-website.

The posts view shows all the articles you're site contains right now.
You may want to switch between categories (which conform to
subdirectories that live within `_posts`)

One more click and you're ready to edit an article. Just move the cursor
to the Content Editor and write some Markdown code. Confirm you changes
by hitting Publish and you're done.
