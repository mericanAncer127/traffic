One of the biggest unsolved problems of our society is most definitely `Content Management`. There've been millions of attempts to solve it. All of them failed. So here's another ambitious attempt of failing less.

Here at [Development Seed](http://developmentseed.org) we're building a lot of websites and we've clearly found our tool of choice to realize them, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/):

> â€¦ a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server.

Read Young Hahn's excellent [post](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/09/09/jekyll-github-pages/) on why we switched to Jekyll for building our websites. We did never regret, and Jekyll became our very best friend, along with Markdown and [Github](http://github.com).

Website developers prefer to have full freedom about how to structure their site. They know how to deal with HTML and CSS. And most of them are familiar with template languages. We've found that Jekyll is a perfect foundation for building a website, from a developer point of view. There's nothing we want to add here.

But what if you're not blessed with the natural ability of writing source code and using Github? What if you were instead a fantastic writer and you want to maintain articles on your website?


# Introducing Prose

**Prose** is a web-interface dedicated for managing dynamic content of Jekyll-based websites. Users can create, edit and delete files that live within the `_posts` directory. Using Jekyll in conjunction with Prose is a smart way of publishing for hackers and [humans](http://www.fyears.org/2012/05/jekyll-for-hackers-not-for-humans).

## Login with your Github User

Sign in using OAUth.

## Browse Repositories

Here's the landing page, it gives you all the repositories you have access to. If a Jekyll site has multiple branches, you are prompted to select your desired branch, otherwise you jump into the repo directly.

## Browsing Posts

Once you have selected a repository, you can browse your posts and sub-folders in a traditional file-browser-ish manner. You can create new files as well, which immediately opens an empty document for you, which you can save after populating it with some text.

## Edit Posts

We use CodeMirror, a great software that makes browser-based editing a pleasure (for the first time). Compared to a regular textarea, which has an annoying inline scrollbar this turned out to be a huge step forward.

## Preview

You can instantly preview your writing by either clicking the preview icon at the document menu bar, or use that keyboard combo `ctrl+shift+p` to toggle Preview on and off.

## Cheatsheet

If you don't write on a daily basis (like me) you might have difficulties to remember the Markdown syntax so we also included a cheatsheet that you can use for reference.

## Publish

Once you are ready, you can easily publish your article, which lets it show up on the actual webpage/blog.

## Metadata

Take full control about your post, and edit Metadata aka the YAML frontmatter. No limitations.

# Not just for Jekyll

The editor not only supports Jekyll websites but can be used to edit any github repository (respectively any contained text file). You can use it to edit `server.js` of your Node.js application for instance. 

![Using the editor for source code](http://f.cl.ly/items/3p2a0a3C3A1I0c3n2o21/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-12%20at%203.12.12%20PM.png)

However, if you ever were to open a Jekyll repository, the editor is smart enough to expose everything below `_posts` and provide Metadata editor for the Jekyll frontmatter as well as a Markdown Preview.

## A writer's paradise

Prose is also suitable as a full-featured writing environment, covering authoring and sharing articles. That's how you can do it:

1. Create a new github repository. And call it... `documents`.
2. Open the editor and create `hello-world.md`.
3. Save it.
4. Share it (we support deep linking to the rendered version)

Prose is pretty similiar to [iAWriter](http://www.iawriter.com/) but it's web-based and uses Github for storage your text so your writings are more than save and Github keeps a history of every saved version. This could become a whole new way of sharing documents, software documentation etc. using just the usual suspects Markdown and Github. Oh and it's free and open source.


# Architecture

Prose is itself just static webpage and doesn't require any server-side bits. Instead it interacts directly with the Github API for managing your repo's contents. This means there's nothing to setup, no database no fileserver no nothing.

Using just the Github API for powering our editor was not easy. We had to be aware of CORS issues and properly setting up headers for authorization. What's challenging here, is that Github just offers a low level API (around trees and blobs), which is problematic in many cases, as it requires a lot of subsequent requests to do simple things, which slows down site performance. That's why creating a good architecture was crucial to manage the complexity. I ended up in abstracting the data layer into a separate module, Github.js.


## Github.js

[Github.js](https://github.com/michael/github) is a higher-level wrapper around the Github API. It's intended for exactly our use case, namely interacting with Github from the browser. It supports reading, writing, renaming and deleting files. Goal was to have a simple data abstraction layer, nothing to fancy, but providing exactly the operations we need.


## Gatekeeper

Because of some [security-related limitations](http://blog.vjeux.com/2012/javascript/github-oauth-login-browser-side.html), Github prevents you from implementing the OAuth Web Application Flow on a client-side only application.

This is a real bummer. So we built [Gatekeeper](http://github.com/developmentseed/gatekeeper), which is the missing piece you need in order to make OAuth work.


# Future

This is a first release dedicated to developers, rbut we'e more than serious about making this rock solid and extend the featureset (while keeping the UI as minimal as possible). We hope our tool can trigger a broader discussion about how static site generators (which are tailored for developer's use) can be combined with visual tools that allow editors to mainain dynamic content. This is meant as an alternative for full-blown Content Management solutions around, such as Drupal, Wordpress or Typo3.


# Get involved

Prose is a true open source effort. You are more than welcome to contribute and help us improving this toolset to make website development and maintainance a pleasure.
