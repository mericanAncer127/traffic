# Introducing Prose

[Prose](http://prose.io) is a web-interface dedicated for managing text-based content in your GitHub repositories. Use it can create, edit and delete files, and save your changes directly to GitHub.

Prose is great for making quick updates to your code, or managing your blog. Prose pays special attention to [Jekyll sites](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) [hosted on GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) with markdown text preview and syntax reference. It's configurable to restrict users to [files that live within the `_posts` directory](help/handbook.html#set_root_url), so you can use it to manage the content on your blog without fear of changing other critical files. Using Jekyll in conjunction with Prose is a smart way of maintaining websites for developers and editors alike, by allowing them to use a visual, web-based tool to manage the content.

## Future plans

This is a first release dedicated to developers at this early stage. It will be buggy as we work out the kinks, but we plan to make this rock solid and extend the featureset (while keeping the UI as minimal as possible). We hope Prose + Jekyll will provide a simple, efficient alternative to traditional CMSs that require web and database servers to host content.


## Get involved

Prose is 100% open source. You are more than welcome to contribute and help us improve this application to make website development and maintainance easier. Start contributing by filing tickets on Github or touch the [codebase](http://github.com/prose).
