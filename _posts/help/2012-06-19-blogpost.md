One of the biggest unsolved problems of our society is most definitely `Content Management`. There've been millions of attempts to solve it. All of them failed. So here's another ambitious attempt of failing less.

Here at [Development Seed](http://developmentseed.org) we're building a lot of websites and we're using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) a lot to build small to medium-sized websites. Read Young Hahn's excellent [post](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/09/09/jekyll-github-pages/) on why we switched to Jekyll for building our websites.

Jekyll is, according to its wiki,

> â€¦ a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server.

We did not regret, and Jekyll became one of our best friends, along with Markdown and [Github](http://github.com).

Website developers prefer to have full freedom about how to structure a site. They know how to deal with HTML and CSS. And most of them are familiar with template languages. We've found that Jekyll is a very good foundation for building a website, from a developer point of view. So there's nothing we want to change here.

But what if you're not blessed with the natural ability of writing source code and using Github? What if you were instead a fantastic writer and you want to maintain articles on your website?


# Introducing Prose

[Prose](http://prose.io) is a web-interface dedicated for managing dynamic content of Jekyll-based websites. Users can create, edit and delete files that live within the `_posts` directory. Using Jekyll in conjunction with Prose is a smart way of maintaining websites not only for developers but also editors by allowing them to use a visual tool to manage the contents.

# Future

This is a first release dedicated to developers at this early stage, but we'e more than serious about making this rock solid and extend the featureset (while keeping the UI as minimal as possible). We hope our tool can trigger a broader discussion about how static site generators (which are tailored for developers) can be combined with visual tools that allow editors to mainain dynamic content. This is meant as a lightweight alternative for full-blown Content Management solutions around, such as Drupal, Wordpress or Typo3. 


# Get involved

Prose is [100% open source](http://). So you are more than welcome to contribute and help us improving this toolset to make website development and maintainance easier. Start contributing by filing tickets on Github or touch the [codebase](http://github.com/prose).
