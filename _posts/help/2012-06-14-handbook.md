# Configuration of your site

Configuration is optional, but in many cases you might want to have more control about the behavior of Prose. You can configure it by including a `prose:` property in your `_config.yml`.

    auto: true
    server: true
    permalink: none
    baseurl: "site_name"
    prose:
      root_url: "_posts" # only files within that folder can be edited
      metadata:
        "_posts/blog":
          title:    "Title of your article"
          abstract: "Abstract"
        "_posts/projects":
          name: "Project Name"
          img:  "Project Thumbnail"
